# Repository to learn GitHub

This is my first repository created on GitHub.

With this first repository I would like to learn
- how to edit and save code on GitHub
- how to test code using GitHub
- how to handle these things in Sublime Text 3 using the plugin 'Git Gutter'

More information on formatting text in .md can be found at ["Basic writing and formatting syntax"](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/)

More information on GitGutter can be found at ["GitGutter"](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/GitGutter)
